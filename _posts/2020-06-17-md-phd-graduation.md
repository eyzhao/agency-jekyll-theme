I am tremendously privileged to graduate from the
[UBC MD/PhD program](https://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/mdphd/) standing upon
the shoulders of a community of mentors, colleagues, and friends. I
could not have anticipated that this time would come during a global
pandemic, but the current situation only emphasizes the need for
clinician-scientists, prepared to overcome pressing clinical challenges
through research. I am proud to see many of my fellow MD/PhD colleagues
applying their biomedical research skills to the urgent clinical and
biological questions underlying SARS-CoV-2 and its societal impacts.

As unconventional as today's graduation has been, it has been stirring
for me to look back at the past seven years.
The MD/PhD program has been the pinnacle formative experience of my
life thus far. It has challenged and supported me through seven rewarding years
of non-stop personal and professional development. I wholeheartedly
recommend the UBC MD/PhD program to anyone passionate about pursuing an
impactful career as a clinician-scientist. Given the opportunity, I
would choose to do it all again.

> To future UBC MD/PhD students and
applicants, do not hesitate to [contact me](https://mailhide.io/e/34ShD).
I would be delighted to learn
your career aspirations and answer any questions or concerns. We are
strongest as a cohesive and supportive community, and your success is my
success.

Through my research, I am thoroughly convinced that open, deep, and
comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome is at the core of precision
oncology. The Personalized Oncogenomics (POG) Program at BC Cancer and
Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre has established itself as
a world leader in research leveraging the whole genome and transcriptome
for treatment selection. I am honoured to have been a part of POG from
its early days to its recent publication of the [first 570 cases in
Nature Cancer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-020-0050-6). POG
is extraordinarily supportive of its trainees, as manifested through its
project design, publication policy, and allocation of funding. POG's
structure makes trainees feel welcomed, empowered, and valued, and
serves as an unparalleled career launchpad for anyone interested in
precision oncology research.

# Acknowledgements 

As I move forward towards medical residency, I want to take a look back
and send gratitude to the peers and mentors who have made the past
seven years so memorable and productive.

## Research Colleagues

I an infinitely grateful to my supervisor
**Dr. Steven Jones** for his research/career mentorship and for always
challenging me to expand my vision and tap into the resources and
opportunities available to me. I would also like to thank **Dr. Marco
Marra**, who was my earliest research supervisor back in 2010 and has
been a constant source of mentorship and inspiration since. A big thank
you to my fellow graduate students and research colleagues (who are too
many to list but are acknowledged in my [PhD
thesis](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0374139)).
Lastly, thank you to all the uniquely visionary cancer physicians I have
met through POG, especially **Drs. Janessa Laskin**, **Daniel Renouf**,
**Sophie Sun**, **Kasmintan Schrader,** **Howard Lim**, **Karen
Gelmon**, **Xiaolan Feng**, **Stephen Chia**, **Diego Villa**, **David
Schaeffer**, **Jonn Wu**, **Christian Steidl**, and **Stephen Yip**.

## Fellow Students

Thank you to my fellow MD/PhD students, past and present, for your
companionship along this journey. The past seven years would not be the
same without eye-opening conversations on life and purpose with
**Philip**, warm and galvanizing "thesis reality checks" with
**Andrea**, commiserating on data science bottlenecks with **Allen**, or
sharing in the med student community and the arts with **Amanda**. It
has been a privilege to witness your early careers as you become rising
stars your fields. I am also grateful for the friendships formed with
individuals in the **MD classes of 2016-2020**, the staff of the
**Medical Student and Alumni Centre**, as well as fellow representatives
of the **Medical Undergraduate Society**, **Canadian Federation of
Medical Students**, and the **Clinician-Scientist Trainee Association of
Canada**.

## MD/PhD Program and Faculty of Medicine

I could not have asked for better MD/PhD program directors and staff,
who have supported me in more ways than I can count. The guidance of
**Dr. Lynn Raymond** and **Dr. Torsten Nielsen** through the early years
helped me navigate the unsteady waters of award applications, committee
meetings, and the formation of my professional identity. Their every
decision has been rooted in kindness and compassion, with the best
interests of students at heart. I appreciate their willingness to
"rattle spears" for our benefit. Whether it's arranging a stellar
line-up of clinician-scientist mentors to speak at the Building Bridges
seminars or offering to rally Faculty support for an unconventional but
valuable clinical elective, their willingness to go above and beyond to
fight on our behalf has been unparalleled. Congratulations to Dr.
Raymond on her illustrious term as MD/PhD program director, and for her
directorship of the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health. I am
excited to see **Dr. Liam Brunham** step in as Associate Director. Last
but not least, I am deeply grateful to **Jane Lee**, the heartbeat of
the MD/PhD program, who has been ever responsive, infinitely patient,
and always knowledgeable.

My sincerest thanks also go out to the **MD/PhD program committee**, as
well as the various institutional partners who make the program what it
is. In particular, I'd like to acknowledge **Dr. Cheryl Holmes** and
**Dr. Roger Wong** for their support of the program and for being
personal mentors throughout my time in the Faculty of Medicine.
Thank you to  Lastly,
a warm thank you to **Student Affairs**, especially **Dr. Janette
McMillan**, for being there for myself and my peers during challenging
times.

# The Road Ahead

> I look forward to using all that I have learned at UBC to tackle new challenges in an ever more collaborative national cancer research landscape.

After 11 years at UBC, it is with excitement and a full heart that I
join the **Department of Radiation Oncology at The University of
Toronto** for my residency training. I chose this program for its record
of rigorous clinical training and support for research. I am delighted
to continue pursuing my research endeavours in Toronto under the
supervision of **Dr. Scott Bratman** and **Dr.** **Trevor Pugh**. I look
forward to using all that I have learned at UBC to tackle new challenges
in an ever more collaborative national cancer research landscape. I look
forward to keeping in touch and working closely with my BC-based
colleagues in the future.

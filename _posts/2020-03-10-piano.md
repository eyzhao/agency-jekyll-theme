Every spring, the UBC Faculty of Medicine hosts a unique and memorable
event known as the [Spring Gala](http://www.ubcmedspringgala.com/).
It takes place at the [Chan Centre](https://chancentre.com/), and
brings together the entire medical community at UBC to enjoy high-level
performances of music, dance, and other artistic endeavours.

This year, I had the privilege to play piano alongside my fellow medical
student Dr. Sabine Lague (on flute) and the UBC President,
Dr. Santa Ono (on cello). Together, we performed the Trio in D Minor,
Op. 49 no. 1, Mvt. I (Abridged) by Felix Mendelssohn, one of my
all time favorite pieces of classical music.

Aside from being one of the most nervous I've been in medical school,
it was without a doubt the highlight of my eleven years at UBC.
This is my fourth piano performance at the UBC Spring Gala.
